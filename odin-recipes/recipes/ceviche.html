<h3>Description</h3>
<p>This is Authentic Mexican Ceviche, I've had it several times in Mexico, and also have learned to cook Mexican food for
my family. Every time I make this it's a hit.</p>
<p>Learn how to make this popular, Mexican-Style Shrimp Ceviche with shrimp, lime juice, avocado, jalapeño, cilantro and
finish it off with some hot sauce if that is your style.</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<p>

        <li>5 large lemons, juiced</li>
        <li>1 pound jumbo shrimp, peeled and deveined</li>

        <li>tomato and clam juice cocktail</li>
        <li>2 white onions, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 cucumber, peeled and finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 large tomatoes, seeded and chopped</li>
        <li>3 fresh jalapeno peppers, seeded and minced</li>
        <li>1 bunch radishes, finely diced</li>

</p>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<p>
    <ol>
        <li>Place shrimp in a bowl (You may either coarsely chop the shrimp, or leave them whole, depending on your preference.) Add
        lemon, covering shrimp completely. Cover, and refrigerate for 30 minutes, or until opaque and slightly firm.</li>
        <li>Add tomatoes, onions, cucumber, radishes, and garlic; toss to combine. Gradually add cilantro and jalapenos to desired
        taste (jalapeno will grow stronger while marinating). Stir in tomato and clam juices to desired consistency. Cover, and
        refrigerate for 1 hour. Serve chilled with tortilla chips.</li>
